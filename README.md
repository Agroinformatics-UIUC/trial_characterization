# Trial caracterization code using APSIM

# Objective
This code takes a csv with information from trials (crop, planting date, latitude, longitude). The csv should always have the same columns as the sample.
It downloads soil and weather information and it runs APSIM for each trial.
In the output will add columns to the original csv with soil, weather and APSIM information .

# Use
The caracterization variables can be used to caracterize the environment of the trials, find clusters of trials with similar conditions, use the variables as regressors to explain the trial results, extrapolate results to areas were trials were not done.

# About the code
The codes are numbered in order they need to be excecuted. Only the first four codes need to be run, and the other ones will be called by this four codes.
